            <h1><u>My Biggest Project!</u></h1>
            <p>I have finally completed my second year of computer science, as well as my largest project! One of my second-year courses was a project course that required us to build a Web application that parses GEDCOM (See what that is by clicking <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/genealogy-gedcom-basics-1421891" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>) files and provides a UI. Users are able to view all individuals in a file. As well as request the ancestors or descendants of a specified person.</p>
            <p>The parser was written in C which I am comfortable with, the difficulty arose with all the assignment specifications and GEDCOM file specs. Once that was finally done, I had to design the front end of the Website using HTML and CSS which I was quite comfortable with. Javascript was used for dynamic loading and AJAX calls for client/server communication. The final component requires basic MySQL which was not too difficult to pick up on. I learned to make queries to a DBMS which stored all the parsed data onto a Data Base. It was by far my favourite course and an amazing learning experience.</p>
            <p>I will soon Post more about this assignment and a visual so you can see what the heck I'm talking about. But for now, its time to learn as much as I can, and find a job!!</p>
