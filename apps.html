            <h4><u>Get The Money (1-Person Project)</u></h4>
            <p>   This application is compatible only with Android devices. Get The Money is a straight forward game. It throws oncoming bags of money ($40) towards the flying character (the animated version of me). The objective is to gather as much money as you can! Seems simple right? Wrong! Red cash bags are also coming at you a little faster, they strip you of $70! On top of that, there are two robbers. One that steals half your money, and the other (less common) steals all your money (Game Over)! The purpose is to avoid going bankrupt or getting robbed of all your money. When creating this, the main purpose was to learn application development and to get familiar with Android Studio. The process of developing the app was loads of fun considering I had the freedom to create whatever I wanted! Which is why I chose myself to be the flying character.</p>

            <h4><u>FITNESS APP (2-Person Project)</u></h4>
            <p>   This fitness application is a project intended for me to learn and familiarize myself with integrating my own work with someone else's. There are multiple components to the app and some have yet to be made. A key feature is to inform the user the number of macros they should intake in order to achieve their goal. To perform these calculations, the app requires specific information such as height, weight, whether they are active or not etc.  Overall the app can be used as a fitness organizer. It offers a planner in which users may organize their weakly workouts. Not to mention, the app includes a stopwatch and timer. There is also a hydration tracker, each tap on the cup corresponds to 1 cup of water (235ml). It is intended to keep the user hydrated.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <img src="../Images/register.png" class="image2">
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="../Images/water.png">
              </li>
              <li>
                <img src="../Images/planner.png">
              </li>
              <li>
               <img src="../Images/sWatch.png">
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4><u>The Final Product</u></h4>
            <p>The application is still a working progress, the components mentioned above are functional but have yet to be combined. Once completed, the hydration feature is meant to give reminders to the user to drink water every so often. The login information is linked to firebase which handles all the authentication. This is temporary as I look to learn how to do this myself. Overall this application is meant to make it easier to achieve your fitness goal, live a healthier lifestyle and organize your workouts. Additional components that have yet to be made include a step counter, syncing to the users calander for a visual of how their workouts layout within a week. Also the database for storing user information has yet to be built as I am currently learning to construct this component.</p>
